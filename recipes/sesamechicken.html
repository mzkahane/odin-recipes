        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp toastes sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>... and more ...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl stir together the soy 
                sauce, water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fresh 
                ginger, minced garlic, cornstarch, and sesame seeds. (Grate the 
                ginger with a small-holed cheese grater). Set the sauce aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and 
                a pinch of salt and pepper. Trim any excess fat from the 
                chicken thighs, then cut them into small 1 inch pieces. Toss 
                the chicken in the egg and cornstarch mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium 
                flame. Wait until the skillet is very hot, then swirl the 
                skillet to make sure the oil coats the entire surface. Add the 
                batter coated chicken and spread it out into a single layer 
                over the surface of the skillet. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the chicken pieces to cook, undisturbed, until golden 
                brown on the bottom. Then, carefully flip the chicken, breaking 
                up the pieces into smaller clumps as you flip. Continue to cook 
                the chicken until golden brown on the other side. Stir the 
                chicken as little as possible to avoid breaking the egg 
                coating from the surface of the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the chicken is cooked through and golden brown on all 
                sides, pour the sauce over top. Toss the chicken to coat in the 
                sauce. As the sauce comes up to a simmer, it will begin to 
                thicken. Continue to gently stir the chicken in the sauce until 
                it has thickened, then turn off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the chicken over a bed of rice and sprinkle the sliced 
                green onions over top.
            </li>
        </ol>
