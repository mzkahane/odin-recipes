        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            For many Japanese, a bowl of delicious miso soup is a daily 
            necessity for the soul. Today, I want to introduce Homemade Instant 
            Miso Soup (即席味噌汁) that you can make ahead to pack for lunch or have 
            in the fridge. You just need to add hot water! It's the perfect 
            meal-prep solution when you crave this soothing and comforting 
            savory soup but you're on the go and too busy to cook.
        </p>
        <p>
            My Homemade Instant Miso Soup recipe is a single-serving, 
            refrigerated “soup kit” with all the ingredients you need to make 
            miso soup, minus the hot water. Stored in a mason jar, you simply 
            add hot water and stir. It's ready to enjoy right from the jar! 
            This instant miso soup will keep for up to 6 days in the 
            refrigerator. It's perfect to meal prep for the busy week ahead.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the aburaage.</strong> Boil water and pour the 
                hot water over both sides of the deep-fried tofu pouch. Cool 
                and pat dry with a paper towel or squeeze dry. Cut into thin 
                strips.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cut the green onions/scallions</strong> and pat dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spoon a scoop of miso</strong> into each mason jar. Add 
                dashi powder if your miso does not include dashi.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the other ingredients</strong> (the aburaage, green 
                onion, and dried wakame seaweed) to the jars and seal with 
                lids.
            </li>

                <strong>Refrigerate</strong> and consume within 6 days.
