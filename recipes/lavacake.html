            cakes at home. They are the perfect individual desserts that are 
            purposefully slightly undercooked, resulting in a gooey and melty

            Mother's Day or a regular weekend, these molten chocolate cakes 
            are so easy to whip together. You only need some pantry staples, 
            making them perfect as a last-minute dessert.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="Ingredients">
            <li>1/2 Cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 Oz bittersweet chocolate</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 Tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 450F. Butter and lightly flour 6 
                (4- to 5-ounce) ramekins and place them on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the butter and chocolate in a double boiler and melt 
                over low heat, stirring until smooth. Or, place the butter and 
                chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, 
                stirring every 30-seconds until melted. Whisk together until 
                smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and 
                salt. Beat on medium speed until thick and pale yellow. Fold 
                the chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture until well 
                combined. Divide the batter among the prepared ramekins. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes are 
                firm set but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool in the 
                ramekins for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and 
                carefully turn it over, inverting the cake onto the plate. Let 
                stand for about 10 seconds, then remove the ramekin to unmold 
                the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with berries, 
                if desired. Serve immediately.
